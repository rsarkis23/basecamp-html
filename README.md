# Intermediate HTML & CSS

In this project, you will be pushed to your HTML & CSS limits.

You should see an index.html, style.css and mockup.png in the folder. Take a look at the mockup.png file. This is what you will be aiming to replicate. This is meant to challenge you. It should be difficult. Don't worry about it being pixel perfect but try your hardest. Also, don't worry about the text or the image of the elephant. They can be text or images of whatever you want. 

You learn the most from these struggles.
